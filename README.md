# FoodChatBot

Welcome to the FoodChatBot project! This repository contains the code for a chatbot designed to streamline the process of ordering food and tracking orders. The chatbot is built using Dialogflow for natural language understanding and processing. It interacts with users to take their food orders and provides updates on the status of their orders. Additionally, the backend is powered by a SQL database to store order information, and a demo frontend is provided to visualize the functionality of the chatbot.

## Features

- **Ordering Food**: Users can interact with the chatbot to place their food orders using natural language.
- **Order Tracking**: The chatbot provides real-time updates on the status of orders, allowing users to track their orders conveniently.
- **Dialogflow Integration**: Utilizes Dialogflow for natural language processing, enabling seamless communication between users and the chatbot.
- **FastAPI for API Requests**: FastAPI is used to handle API requests, providing a high-performance framework for building APIs.
- **MySQL Connector for Database Connectivity**: MySQL Connector for Python is used to connect to the MySQL database, enabling interaction with the backend database.
- **ngrok for HTTPS Tunneling**: ngrok is utilized to create a secure HTTPS tunnel to the local server, enabling secure communication over the internet.

## Installation

To run the FoodChatBot project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FoodChatBot.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Python and pip installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the SQL database:

   - Ensure you have a SQL database set up (e.g., MySQL).
   - Import the provided SQL schema (`schema.sql`) to create the necessary tables.

4. Configure the backend:

   - Update the database connection settings in `backend/config.py` with your database credentials.

5. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. Use ngrok to create an HTTPS tunnel:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

7. Obtain the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok and update the Dialogflow fulfillment webhook URL accordingly.

8. Access the demo frontend in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can interact with the FoodChatBot through the demo frontend. Simply type your food order or query, and the chatbot will respond accordingly. You can also track the status of your orders by providing your order details.
